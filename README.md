Cosmic Breakout
===============

I built this project using MPLAB IDE.

There's three directories of images -- fonts, levels and sprites. The three
corresponding header files were generated with the three (largely similar) Python
scripts. You'll need Python (I used 2.7.3) and PyGame (I used 1.9.1) if you want
to edit the images and regenerate the headers.
